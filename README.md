## An OpenType font parser in JavaScript

This is a pure JavaScript parser for OpenType font files. It supports fonts with CFF and TrueType outlines, and can read fonts wrapped as WOFF.

The following OpenType tables are currently supported:

* CMAP (only format 0, 4, 12, and 13)
* head
* hhea
* maxp
* hmtx
* name
* OS/2
* post
* GSUB (excluding LookupType 5, 6, 7, and 8)
* GDEF (only the Glyph Class Definitions)
* gasp

This roughly corresponds to all the metadata available in most fonts.

## Usage

This fork is already compiled with Grunt. Please check the `build` folder for the compiled `opentype.js` file. 

Then include `build/opentype.js` into your page and pass the `opentype.parse` method an `ArrayBuffer` instance:

    var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(...);

    var font = opentype.parse(buffer);

The `font` variable will now contain a JSON representation of all supported OpenType tables. Later versions of this library will support parsing only select OpenType tables.

You can also use `glyphArray` and `glyphData` to quickly understand which glyphs are supported in the parsed font. `glyphArray` returns a array and `glyphData` returns an object. 

## Browser Support

This library extensively uses `ArrayBuffer`'s, and `DataView`'s so you will need a browser that supports those. Any recent version of Safari or Firefox will do. Tested on Safari 9.
